# Introduction

Hi! I'm Qian Hui 😊, currently pursuing a **Master of Computer Science (Applied Computing)** in mixed-mode 🎓. I’m also working full-time as an **SAP Technical Analyst** 💻 while juggling my studies. My journey in tech has led me to gain hands-on experience in **web development** (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SAPUI5) 🌐, **backend development** (Java, Python) 🔧, and other exciting tech fields.

When I'm not coding, you’ll find me **traveling** ✈️, **watching dramas** 📺, or **listening to music** 🎶. I'm passionate about enhancing my skills and embracing new challenges in the tech world.
